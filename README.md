### Hi, I'm Saoirse

I'm a former Science teacher turned software developer with a keen interest in full-stack development and data science.

I've recently completed the [Tech Returners](https://www.techreturners.com/) journey into tech course, upskilling in full-stack JavaScript and AWS technologies.
You can see my individual project work [here](https://github.com/smbryar/todo_react_application) and [here](https://github.com/smbryar/todo-application-backend), and my two-week group project work [here](https://github.com/GrokItTeam).

Beyond the course I am continuously upskilling, completing online courses in MATLAB, Azure fundamentals and Python for Data Science.
